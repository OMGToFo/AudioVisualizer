# AudioVisualizer
Simple Audio Visualizer


A simple Streamlit app that listens to the audio input of a computer and generates real-time visual patterns based on the rhythm or amplitude of the music.

The idea is to use the pyaudio library to capture sound and matplotlib or plotly to generate visualizations, which will be displayed in Streamlit.
